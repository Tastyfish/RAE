# RAD Tests

Here are some tests and example projects utilizing the engine.

## LazyQuest
This is the main example project.
It is technically a stand-alone game where the goal is to collect the most proofs of purchase.

Compile via `clz.cmd` if `src` and `clz.cmd` are in the same folder as the compiled `rae.exe`.

## 905
Another example project based on an old short game on the internet.

Compile via `905.cmd` if `905s` and `905.cmd` are in the same folder as the compiled `rae.exe`.

## The rest.
Most of the rest of the file can be directly run on their own via `rae.exe [file name]`.

`key.rad` needs to also have LazyQuest's verbs via `rae.exe key.rad src/v.rad`.
